# file-explorer
A basic file explorer for windows (Electron)

This application is a basic test electron.js. Code is not great, neither is the interface. Just a basic application to test Electron.js and the possibilities of JS in software development.

# Running the application
At first do the basic npm i, then a simple npm start is enough
